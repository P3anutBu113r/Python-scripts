The year is 3000, and youâ€™re on the run. Just last week, you managed to break free from the tyrannical rule of Lord Zorb and escape to the stars with your people. But now, one obstacle stands between you and freedom: Lord Zorb knows about your escape, and he has unleashed a relentless hail of asteroids to stop you.
